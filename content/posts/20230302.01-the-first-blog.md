Why
===

Had a gap week, and thought it will be nice to start tracking some 
of my recent work.

How
===

This blog is created by Hugo.

Hugo is a static site generator using markdown as the source.
See https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ to get started.

Publishing
==========

The site will be published to Github pages.
It will also be accessed through https://blog.sohoffice.com

It uses Github actions to build on commit.
